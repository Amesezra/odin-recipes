        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>For my first recipe of 2022 I chose these garlic green beans (Kkeopjilkong maneul bokkeum: 껍질콩 마늘 볶음), something that I always make and that just happen to be healthy. When I need some green stuff as a side dish I often choose this or sigeumchi-namul. I love the texture of well-cooked green beans stir fried with onions and lots of garlic. It’s a great side dish for rice.

            When I lived in Korea green beans was an unusual ingredient, but these days it’s a different story and many Koreans cook with them. Green beans are known as being full of vitamins, nutrients and fiber. They are also full of antioxidants and good for your heart and gut, low in calories and aid in a healthy pregnancy! So when I cook this dish I love the taste and texture and after eating it I feel very healthy.
            
            I usually make 2 pounds’ worth and eat a lot of them, but for the sake of this recipe I am making it with one pound. If you find you love them as much as I do, double the recipe next time!</p>
